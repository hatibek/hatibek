### Projects

My latest project, Game of Life: Developer Edition, is a multiplayer online board game inspired by the classic Game of Life. This was a group project where I attended daily standups, code reviews, demo day, and I did a combination of pair programming and individual work both on the back-end and front-end thoughout the production process. We built the game using Phaser, Express, Socket.io, and Firebase. Here's a preview of game features --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d_im9-ARUM&ab_channel=HatibeKabulantok
